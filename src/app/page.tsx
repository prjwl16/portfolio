          Lately, Iâ€™ve been building something of my own an idea that sits at the intersection of tech, habits,
          and care. It&#39;s early, still evolving, but rooted in a real problem that I think deserves a better
          solution. Most of the work happens quietly, in between work hours and long walks, but itâ€™s the kind of
          thing that makes me want to open my laptop even on tired days.

            I like software that feels thoughtful the kind thatâ€™s clean, fast, and doesnâ€™t make users suffer.
            I&#39;m into systems, structure, and the little design choices most people ignore.
            Currently figuring out how to get better at all of it, one bug fix and brain dump at a time.
